"""

This directory contains a number of example command line apps.

They are intentionally very simple and not exactly a finished product, but
all these examples are completely functional.

You typically run then from the command line with the following:

    python -m fs.examples.SCRIPT

See the docstrings for details.

Note that if the command requires a path, a FS URL will also work. So the
script will work with archives / servers etc.
